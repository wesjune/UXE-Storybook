# DataTable

By offering UX and DX features, the `DataTable` component provides a robust and flexible solution for displaying tabular data, catering to both end-users and developers effectively.

## User Experience (UX)

### Responsive Design

The `DataTable` component is designed to handle various screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

### Interactive Cells

The component supports interactive cells, such as switches and dropdown menus, allowing users to perform actions directly within the table.

### Fixed Columns

The options to fix the first and last columns make it easier for users to navigate wide tables without losing context.

### Sorting

Users can sort columns by clicking on the headers, providing an intuitive way to organize data.

### Pagination

Built-in pagination controls allow users to navigate through large datasets without overwhelming the interface.

### Empty State Handling

The table displays a user-friendly message ("No results") when there are no data to show, ensuring clarity and preventing confusion.

### Accessibility

The use of semantic HTML elements (`table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `td`) enhances accessibility, ensuring the table is usable by screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Developer Experience (DX)

### TypeScript Support

The use of TypeScript provides strong type-checking, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors.

### Component-Based Architecture

The `DataTable` uses a modular approach, allowing developers to easily integrate and customize components like `Table`, `TableHeader`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, and `TableCell`.

### Flexibility with Column Definitions

Developers can define columns using `ColumnDef` with various options like `header`, `cell`, and `accessorKey`, making it easy to customize the table's appearance and behavior.

### Extensibility

The component is designed to be easily extendable. Developers can add new features or modify existing ones without overhauling the entire component.

### Reusable Components

Elements like `Button`, `Switch`, and `DropdownMenu` are reusable, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and making the development process more efficient.

## Component Optimization

To ensure the `DataTable` component system evolves effectively and remains optimized, a clear and structured plan is essential. The plan should focus on modularity, performance, testing, documentation, and continuous improvement. Below is a detailed proposal:

- Decompose the `DataTable` into smaller, reusable components (e.g., `TableHeader`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, `TableCell`, `TablePagination`).
- Integrate virtualization using `react-virtual` for rendering large datasets efficiently.
- Utilize `memoization` techniques with `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `Jest` and `React Testing Library` to write comprehensive unit tests for each component.
